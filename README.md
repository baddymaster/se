Note: Replace the links in the main file where the data is stored on your computer. We used the [Enron dataset] (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/) in the paper.

The code was written and tested on a Mac machine.

If you have any questions about the code or the paper, please email me at naveed2 at illinois dot edu.
